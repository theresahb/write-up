            My love for technology grew when I was a kid. But it was just using the computer to play games and all.
            Because that's all I knew. The love for technology became heightened when in primary and high school.
            Didn't pursue anything in technology till I came to the university. I decided to opt into it.
            I love everything about how people use to command the computer into doing something. Tech is fun and isn't easy.

            I have learn a lot in Stutern. Have in-depth knowledge in HTML and getting good in CSS too.
            <b>CSS</b> <i>makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience.</i> 
            Without <b>CSS</b>, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. 
            In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.
